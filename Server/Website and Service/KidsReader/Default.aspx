                    There&#39;s a few REALLY good apps out there to help kids read, but there&#39;s none I could find that really meet my needs.&nbsp; Here&#39;s the list of things I want to do...<br />
        <br />
        Have stories that can be read, but if a word is too difficult, you can click on it to be read aloud<br />
        You can use your own stories.&nbsp; Enter in some content from your childs homework so they can use the phone to read.<br />
        Handle word lists.&nbsp; Really no different than a story, only focused on sdpecific words - like flash cards.<br />
        <br />
        I haven&#39;t given a whole lot of thought as to how far I want to go with this app yet - possiilities are truely endless.&nbsp; I&#39;ll probably add a &#39;User Feedback&#39; area here to see what people want to see added most.&nbsp; Or a facebook page.
